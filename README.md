# My realisation of simple online test.
Simple example of online-test on JS (node-js for mail the results). </br>
!!WARNING!! JUNK-CODE!!!</br>
Don't use this to studying of good coding!!!</br>
All main files, if u need it without node-js in 'public' folder. </br>
If u need mail-sender, just download this files, change mail and password in 'sended' file and 'node sended'
